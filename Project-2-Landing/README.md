# Landing Page Website - TOP second project

## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Christian Ortiz, and this is my solution for the landing page project on [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

### This is one of my projects while learning front-end web development. My other projects can be seen [here.](https://github.com/progchris00)

- Live Site URL - [Github Page](https://progchris00.github.io/TOP-Projects/Project-2-Landing)

## Project Description
This website is one of the projects I created while taking the foundational section of the [Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

On this project, I applied all the knowledge I gained while studying the foundational topics. 

The content of the website is just made up and does not portray a real-world brand.

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to imitate the design using the knowledge the learners have gained so far. [Image One (Full Design)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png), [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)

However, it is also stated that the content and design can be substituted, thus requiring me to create and apply my own design while following the given wire frame.

## Inspiration
Some inspiration for the project's design comes from this short [tiktok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@its_baqi/video/7230124876332272902)
